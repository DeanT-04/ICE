# Security Scanning Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The Ultra-Fast AI Model project implements a comprehensive security scanning pipeline to ensure the security and integrity of the codebase. This pipeline uses multiple specialized tools to detect vulnerabilities, security issues, and compliance violations across Rust, Go, and container components.

## Security Tools

### 1. Cargo Audit (Rust Dependencies)
- **Purpose**: Scans Rust dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
- **Database**: RustSec Advisory Database
- **Configuration**: `security/security-scan.toml`
- **Output**: JSON format with vulnerability details

### 2. Cargo Deny (Rust Policy Enforcement)
- **Purpose**: Enforces licensing, advisory, and dependency policies
- **Configuration**: `deny.toml` (auto-generated)
- **Features**:
  - License compliance checking
  - Dependency version conflicts
  - Advisory vulnerability detection
  - Banned dependency enforcement

### 3. Gosec (Go Security Scanner)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes Go code for security vulnerabilities
- **Coverage**: SQL injection, XSS, crypto issues, file access
- **Configuration**: Built-in rules with custom exclusions
- **Target**: `src/mcp/` directory (Go MCP interfaces)

### 4. Trivy (Container & Dependency Scanner)
- **Purpose**: Multi-purpose vulnerability scanner
- **Capabilities**:
  - Container image vulnerabilities
  - Filesystem vulnerabilities
  - Secret detection
  - Misconfiguration detection
  - License scanning

### 5. Additional Security Checks
- **Secret scanning**: Hardcoded credentials and API keys
- **Unsafe pattern detection**: Rust unsafe blocks and dangerous patterns
- **Configuration validation**: Security misconfigurations

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install security tools
make install-security-tools

# Run quick security scan
make security-quick

# Run full security scan
make security

# Run CI-friendly security scan
make security-ci

# Run all quality checks including security
make check-all
```

### PowerShell Script Usage

```powershell
# Full security scan
./scripts/run_security_scan.ps1 -Mode full

# Quick scan for development
./scripts/run_security_scan.ps1 -Mode quick

# CI scan with fail-fast
./scripts/run_security_scan.ps1 -Mode ci -FailFast

# Update security databases
./scripts/run_security_scan.ps1 -UpdateDbs
```

## Configuration

### Security Scan Configuration (`security/security-scan.toml`)

```toml
[global]
security_level = "high"
fail_on_high_severity = true
max_allowed_vulnerabilities = 0

[rust]
enabled = true
audit_db_update = true
ignore_yanked = false

[go]
enabled = true
scan_tests = true
exclude_rules = []

[container]
enabled = true
scan_dockerfile = true
scan_dependencies = true
scan_secrets = true
```

### Cargo Deny Configuration (`deny.toml`)

Automatically generated with secure defaults:
- Denies GPL and AGPL licenses
- Allows MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD licenses
- Warns on multiple dependency versions
- Denies known vulnerabilities

## Security Thresholds

### Vulnerability Severity Levels

1. **CRITICAL**: Immediate action required, CI fails
2. **HIGH**: Review required, warnings generated
3. **MEDIUM**: Track and schedule fixes
4. **LOW**: Informational, no action required

### Compliance Frameworks

- OWASP Top 10
- CWE Top 25
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The security scanning pipeline is integrated into GitHub Actions:
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, PRs, scheduled daily scans
- **Matrix strategy**: Separate jobs for Rust, Go, and container scanning
- **Artifacts**: Security reports stored for 30-90 days
- **Notifications**: PR comments with security status

### Security Gates

- **Development**: Warnings only, no build failures
- **Staging**: High severity issues block deployment
- **Production**: Critical and high severity issues block deployment

## Output and Reporting

### Report Formats

1. **JSON Reports**: Machine-readable for CI/CD integration
2. **HTML Reports**: Human-readable dashboards
3. **Markdown Summaries**: Embedded in PR comments

### Report Locations

```

├── rust-audit.json           # Cargo audit results
├── rust-deny.json            # Cargo deny results
├── go-gosec.json             # Gosec scan results
├── trivy-dependencies.json   # Trivy dependency scan

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tool Installation Failures**
   ```bash
   # Manual installation
   cargo install --locked cargo-audit
   go install github.com/securecodewarrior/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest
   docker pull aquasec/trivy:latest
   ```

2. **Database Update Failures**
   ```bash
   # Update manually
   cargo audit --update-db
   trivy --cache-dir .cache/trivy --update-db
   ```

3. **Go Module Issues**
   ```bash
   cd src/mcp
   go mod tidy
   go mod verify
   ```

### Permission Issues

On Windows, ensure PowerShell execution policy allows script execution:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Pre-commit**: Run `make security-quick` before committing
2. **Feature branches**: Full security scan on CI
3. **Main branch**: Daily scheduled security scans
4. **Release**: Comprehensive security validation

### Vulnerability Management

1. **Immediate response**: Critical vulnerabilities (< 24 hours)
2. **Planned response**: High vulnerabilities (< 1 week)
3. **Monitoring**: Medium/Low vulnerabilities (track and batch)

### False Positive Handling

1. **Review thoroughly**: Ensure it's actually a false positive
2. **Document reasoning**: Why the issue is not applicable
3. **Use exclusions sparingly**: Prefer fixes over ignoring
4. **Regular review**: Revisit exclusions periodically

## Integration with Other Tools

### Mutation Testing
Security scanning complements mutation testing by:
- Verifying dependencies don't introduce vulnerabilities
- Ensuring security-focused tests are effective
- Validating security configurations

### Performance Monitoring
Security considerations for performance:
- Security scanning overhead in CI/CD
- Impact of security updates on performance
- Trade-offs between security and speed

### Energy Monitoring
Security vs. energy efficiency:
- Cryptographic operations power consumption
- Secure communication overhead
- Security monitoring energy impact

## Security Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Vulnerability Count**: Total active vulnerabilities
2. **Time to Fix**: Average time to resolve security issues
3. **Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by security scanning
4. **False Positive Rate**: Accuracy of security tools

### Reporting Dashboard

Monthly security health reports include:
- Vulnerability trend analysis
- Tool effectiveness metrics
- Compliance status
- Remediation progress

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **SAST Integration**: Static Application Security Testing
2. **DAST Integration**: Dynamic Application Security Testing
3. **SCA Enhancement**: Software Composition Analysis
4. **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials

### Advanced Features

1. **ML-based vulnerability prediction**
2. **Automated vulnerability prioritization**
3. **Security debt tracking**
4. **Supply chain risk assessment**
